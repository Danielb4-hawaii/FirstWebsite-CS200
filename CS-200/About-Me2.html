                    Hi all! My name is Daniel Brooks, however, I go by Clay. I have been going by that<br> name since I was born so as you can imagine I am pretty attached to it. I am from<br> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chugiak,_Anchorage" target="_blank">Chugiak, Alaska</a> which is absolutely my favorite place in the entire world. While in<br> high school I dabbled in construction work and restaurant/hospitality services. I plan<br> to become an architect after I finish school. I have always found houses and buildings<br> so interesting and I love to tear them apart and see every last aspect, so I think the<br> career choice is pretty reasonable.

                    This class is not part of my major so I am taking it as an elective, though I can promise<br> I won't treat it as anything less than a required course! The final project looks challenging<br> and fun at the same time so I am optimistic about it. Never have I ever designed a website<br> before, though I did use Google Sites during my high school digital composition class. I am<br> not sure if this will directly help my career in any way but it seems fun and like a good class<br> to take so nonetheless I am here. I look forward to this semester with everyone!
