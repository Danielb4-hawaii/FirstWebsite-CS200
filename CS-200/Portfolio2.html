            <p>This is where my portfolio page is going to be, this is a rough outline seen here. Ideally I want<br>
             a few examples of my Architectural drafts as well as descriptions of each. I have the coding<br>
             shells of what I want, I just need assistance with inbedding the files onto the screen.</p>

        <div class="Example2">
            <p>This is one of my many drafts which will be showcased in this section. This first one is<br>
            actually one of the very first projects in architecture which I completed. It was a simple<br>
            2D draft of the frontside of a villa. I completed this project using the AutoCAD program<br>
            which I am becoming more and more fond of as the days go by!!</p>

            <p>The second draft I have shown hear is actually one of the projects in which i am most proud<br>
            of. This is a sky view draft of a normal house, there is nothing fancy about any of this but it<br>
            was a very time comsuming project at the moment. During the course of this I had learned so many<br>
            new tools for sing AutoCAD.</p>
